In this post, I’ll walk you through how I built **WebChat** — a real-time messaging app using **Next.js**, **WebSockets**, and **Socket.io**. It supports multiple users, bi-directional messaging, and a responsive interface that updates instantly.

The goal: to provide an interactive chat app that feels as fast and fluid as WhatsApp or Discord, but fully built from scratch.

# Architecture

<hr />

At a high level, here’s how the app works:

- **Frontend:** Built with React and Next.js. It uses WebSocket client connections to communicate with the server.
- **Backend:** Powered by Socket.io. It receives messages and broadcasts them to other users in real-time.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend).

# Step 1: Set Up Next.js Project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest webchat
cd webchat
npm install socket.io-client
```
