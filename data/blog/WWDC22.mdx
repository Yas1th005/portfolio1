Sometimes, even experienced developers find managing files a chore — switching folders, renaming, organizing, searching. That’s why I built **FileOS**, a file manager that listens to natural English commands and responds with real actions. Think of it as a command-line assistant… but in plain English.

Here are some of the features I implemented using **Python**, **tkinter**, and **NLP**:

- Natural Language Commands

  - You can say things like:
    - “Move all PDFs to Documents”
    - “Delete all screenshots from Downloads”
    - “Create folder ‘Projects’ inside Desktop”
  - Internally, I used tokenization and simple classification logic to break down intent and parameters from the sentence.

- Real-Time File Monitoring

  - FileOS uses the `watchdog` module to monitor directories and automatically move or categorize files based on extensions and content analysis.

- Semantic File Search

  - Users can search for files using terms like “tech documents” or “images from last week” and the app tries to infer file types and timestamps accordingly.

- GUI Powered by tkinter

  - I built a basic but clean interface using Python’s `tkinter` to let users enter commands, browse suggestions, and preview file actions before executing.

- SQLite-Powered File Cache
  - For large directories, FileOS builds a local cache using SQLite to speed up semantic searches and restore results faster.

While the UI is minimal, the backend was the fun part. Parsing human language and translating it into real filesystem instructions — safely — is a challenge worth solving. FileOS doesn’t aim to be a replacement for your OS, but an augmentation.

> What if file managers were smart enough to understand us instead of the other way around?

That’s the idea behind FileOS. You talk. It listens. It acts.
