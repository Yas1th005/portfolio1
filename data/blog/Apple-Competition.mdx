Drug discovery is slow and expensive. With _Pharmora_, we aimed to make it faster and smarter by integrating AI into bioinformatics workflows. Built with React, Node.js, MongoDB, and OpenAI APIs, the platform supports real-time 3D visualization and LLM-assisted protein sequence analysis.

In this post, I break down how we integrated Docker microservices, HIPAA-like data practices, and CI/CD pipelines on AWS to serve researchers working in molecular biology.
