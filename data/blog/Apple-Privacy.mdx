Earlier this year, I built **Drishya**, an AI-powered web app that tackles one of the most underrated design challenges: intelligent object replacement in images. The goal was to make photo edits smarter — not just pixel-based erasing or cutting — but context-aware masking, segmentation, and seamless blending.

We used [Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://segment-anything.com/) with the ViT-B backbone to handle real-time object segmentation. Users can draw bounding boxes via a custom HTML5 Canvas interface, and the model instantly returns masks for precise object outlines.

But that was just the beginning.

We integrated **OpenCV** to handle edge feathering, alpha blending, and color harmonization — ensuring that the object removal or replacement looked natural and not like a harsh Photoshop job. The whole system was backed by a **Flask** server that optimized model caching and supported GPU acceleration with CPU fallback.

This approach allows users — even non-designers — to:

- Instantly mark and replace product images in a browser.
- Use real-time previews powered by AI masks.
- Perform advanced edits with no external tools.

The idea for Drishya came from noticing how tedious e-commerce workflows can get. Image editors spend hours doing manual work — Drishya offers a way to reduce that to seconds, using AI.

> AI isn’t just about automation. It’s about enabling creativity without needing deep technical skill.
